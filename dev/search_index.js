The data variable will be called varname (followed by the band number). The dataset ds will also have the virtual variables x, y and lon, lat representing the projected coordinates (as defined in the GeoTIFF file) and the corresponding longitude/latitude (using the projection as defined by the projection parameter). The names of the dimensions can be adapted using the parameter dimnames.\n\nSetting catbands to true, will concatenate all bands into a single variable called varname. If catbands is true, it is the user's responsibility to check that all bands have the same no-data value, offset and scale factor. Check with the command line tool gdalinfo filename or ArchGDAL. If this is not the case, catbands = true should not be used.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"}]
